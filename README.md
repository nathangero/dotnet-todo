# .NET Todo Server

## Description

A simple serve to make it easy to test out other frontend frameworks for a full-stack application. This is the `.NET` server for my [React Todo App](https://github.com/nathangero/react-todo) and [Angular Todo App](https://github.com/nathangero/angular-todo).

This is built with `C#`. 

This does simple CRUD operations for a todo list. It handles adding, updating, and deleting a todo. 

## Installation

1. Download the code
2. Make sure you have ASP.NET installed.
3. Open the terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you downloaded the code, and run `dotnet run`.
4. Make sure to download my front end code to fully test the full stack application.
